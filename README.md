## Front-End Development


<p align="center"> <a href="SWIFT.md">Technology : " SWIFT " </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


We use technology swift for our app . Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.

<p align="center"> <a href="MVVM.md">Architecture : " MVVM " </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

We use architecture MVVM for our app . In most of our application, we have a view controller (UI) which needs to fetch data from the server(API) and need to display it in the UI. We will implement the same behavior using the MVVM Pattern.



## Back-End Development


<p align="center"> <a href="postman.md"> " postman " </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

We use postman for our app back-End . It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.


<p align="center"> <a href="mongodb.md"> " mongodb " </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

We use mongodb for our app back-End . MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.


<p align="center"> <a href="vscode.md"> " Visual Studio Code " </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

We use Visual Studio Code for our app back-End . Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
